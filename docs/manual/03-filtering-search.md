# Filtering and Search

Blendtune's advanced filtering system helps you find the perfect track for your creative project. Learn how to use multi-dimensional filters to narrow down thousands of tracks to exactly what you need.

## Overview

The filtering system allows you to search by:
- Genre and subgenre
- Musical key and scale
- Tempo (BPM)
- Mood and emotional tags
- Instruments
- Keywords
- Related artists

All filters work together - you can combine multiple criteria for precise results.

2. Look for the filter panel (usually on the left sidebar)
3. Click to expand filter categories
4. Select your criteria
5. Results update in real-time
